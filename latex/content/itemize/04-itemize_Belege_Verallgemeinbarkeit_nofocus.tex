    \item \textit{"A Tale from the Trenches: Cognitive Biases and Software Development"} von Souti Chattopadhyay, Nicholas Nelson, Audrey Au, Natalia Morales, Christopher Sanchez, Rahul Pandita und Anita Sarma [a654]: "While desirable, generalizability was not the main focus of this study"
    \item \textit{"Here We Go Again: Why Is It Difficult for Developers to Learn Another Programming Language?"} von Nischal Shrestha, Colton Botta, Titus Barik und Chris Parnin [a691]: "Because the sampling approach is non-probabilistic, it does not allow for sample-to-population, or statistical generalization. Rather, our approach targets diversity (rather than representativeness) in order to identify evidence of interference across many different programming languages."
    \item \textit{"Unblind Your Apps: Predicting Natural-Language Labels for Mobile GUI Components by Deep Learning"} von Jieshan Chen, Chunyang Chen, Zhenchang Xing, Xiwei Xu, Liming Zhu, Guoqiang Li und Jinshui Wang [a322] - keine Diskussion Ã¼ber die Verallgemeinbarkeit
