    abstract = {Empirical software research could be improved if there was a systematic way to identify the types of software for which empirical evidence applies. This is because results are unlikely to be globally applicable, but are more likely to apply only in certain contexts such as the type of software on which the evidence has been tested. We present a software taxonomy that should help researchers to apply their research systematically to particular types of software. The taxonomy was generated using existing partial taxonomies and input from survey participants. If a taxonomy such as ours gains acceptance, it will facilitate comparison and appropriate application of research. In the paper, we present the benefits of such a taxonomy, the process we used to develop it, and the taxonomy itself.},

abstract = {In order to draw valid conclusions when aggregating evidence it is important to describe the context in which industrial studies were conducted. This paper structures the context for empirical industrial studies and provides a checklist. The aim is to aid researchers in making informed decisions concerning which parts of the context to include in the descriptions. Furthermore, descriptions of industrial studies were surveyed.},

abstract = {Context is a central concept in empirical software engineering. It is one of the distinctive features of the discipline and it is an in-dispensable part of software practice. It is likely responsible for one of the most challenging methodological and theoretical problems: study-to-study variation in research findings. Still, empirical software engineering research is mostly concerned with attempts to identify universal relationships that are independent of how work settings and other contexts interact with the processes important to software practice. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of how context affects empirical research and how empirical software engineering research can be better 'contextualized' in order to provide a better understanding of what works for whom, where, when, and why. We exemplify the importance of context with examples from recent systematic reviews and offer recommendations on the way forward.},
